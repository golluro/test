This app / module is part of the SICK AppSpace Coding Starter Kit developing approach.
It is programmed in an object oriented way. Some of these modules use kind of "classes" in lua to make it possible to reuse
code / classes in other projects. In general it is not neccessary to code this way, but the architecture of this app
can serve as a sample to be used especially for bigger projects and to make it easier to share code.
Please check the documentation of CSK for further information.
